              <!-- Text -->
              <p>Dr. Karen Ngo graduated from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College after earning an Honours Degree in Kinesiology at the University of Waterloo. It was at the University of Waterloo when Dr. Ngo discovered her passion for dance, specifically latin and old school hip hop. She competed in several local breakdancing battles, as well as, performed for UnitedSalseros at several congresses including the Canada Salsa Congress. Her love and passion for dance and helping people recover through chiropractic care has led her to develop a special interest in working with dancers in the performing arts community. Dr. Ngo is now the team chiropractor for the Professional UnitedSalseros dance team. Dr. Ngo regularly attends the Performing Arts Medicine Association (PAMA) seminars allowing her to connect with healthcare professionals who share the same interest and tapping into the latest research on ways to benefit the artistic community. Dr. Ngo worked with other healthcare professionals conducting screens for dancers of Ballet Jorgen Canada, as well as, setting up outreaches for the street dance community to educate dancers on what they can do to excel in their performance and physical health.</p>
              <p>Besides working with the artistic community, Dr. Ngo is a Certified First Responder who is experienced working with athletes. She has worked along side with sport teams including the GTA AllStars Football Team, Aurora Barbarians Rugby Team, University of Waterloo Male Varsity Basketball Team, as well as hockey teams at the Stoney Creek Girls Hockey Association Midget AA Showcase Tournament. Dr. Ngo loves travelling and learning different cultures and customs around the world. She is a strong advocate for encouraging travellers to give back to the communities they travel through. Dr. Ngo has delivered medical care to local residents, as well as, rehabilitation workshops for doctors and physiotherapists at the Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Hospital in Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam, in the Center of Medical Rehabilitation in Vientiane of Laos, as well as numerous regions in the Dominican Republic. On her free time, you may catch a glimpse of Dr. Ngo powerlifting in the gym, on the dance floor at Dovercourt House, or providing a community outreach at a local event near you.</p>
